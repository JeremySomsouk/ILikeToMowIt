# ILikeToMowIt - Let's start mowing ! 
## Introduction

## Development details

### Step 1
The first step in my reasoning was to find a way to handle the direction of each mower. With that, I was thinking that 
using an ordinal value could help me with a simple operation to shift to the left or right of position using an addition, and a modulo to have a circular pattern.

Since the current direction of a mower will also impact it's next move, I found that using the current position of a mower witch a fixed next step value was coherent and of the domain of a direction. 
That is why I used, for each direction, an xIncrement and yIncrement, that will come handy for the 'F' instruction.
